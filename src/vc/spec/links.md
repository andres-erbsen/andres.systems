## Representing links

If two devices are willing to forward someone elses packets, they sign a
statement about that. Having received a such statement one can be sure that at
least once there was an useable link between the authors of the statement.
To avoid old links getting in the way (intentionally or not) the statements
contains the issue time and should be renewed regularly. Additionally, either of
the authors of the original promise can at any time declare it obsolote -- if
they don't want to service they link they won't, like we it or not.
