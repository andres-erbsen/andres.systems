We like stories (books, movies) about epic missions and all-changing moments.
Soon one realizes, though, that the standard fairytale of Morpheus coming to Neo
to let him change the world never happens, it is inconsistent with the way power
works -- in reality, the grand old man would not need the special disciple.
The message of these stories is clear: heroism belongs to a galaxy far far away
and is predetermined by a higher power, one can not just try and change the
world. We are supposed to learn that we do does not matter. To hell with all this.

A couple of days ago at [30C3] Glenn Greenwald delivered a [keynote] ([transcript])
in which
he, to put it dramatically, said that the freedom of the world is in the hands
of the hackers and geeks listening. That the surveillance state is too total to
be fought in the political arena and if a sense of political freedom is going to
be sustained in the society, it is going to be through cryptography and code.

This is not a fairytale. Neither is [cfp.txt] or the [cypherpunk manifesto]. But
twenty years ago most of us did not foresee this. Now, the mainstream of the mainstream has come to
realize that something along the lines of "crypto-anarchy" may be our only
solution. Even this is not the case, any solution to the situation we are in is
going to be a result of planned and deliberate actions by people who are only
distinguished by their willingness to take action.

Don't get fooled by the Hollywood worship of passivity. The world is out there.
Do something, for any cause you feel motivated by. Be the one who asks the
question. Be the one who takes that hour to read the news between the lines and
understand what is really going on. Be the one who seeks out the people doing
something about it or starts out on their own. If what you care about is
difficult to do, there still is nothing more useless than not trying. If it
takes learning, learn. If it takes dedication, please put in the effort but do
not burn yourself out. This is your life, your world, and if it is at all
possible to do something that matters about it, you can do it. And history has
shown that is is possible. So go, do it.
