After hearing that [I don't use Facebook](../2013-08-10-facebook/),
people ask me what I do use, and some even ask why. You're welcome.

Everything I endorse (mostly by using it) has to be an 
[open standard](http://opensource.org/osr). This means the every detail
about how it works has to be public, free to be reviewed, criticized and
built upon by anybody. For example, email is an open standard, this is
why there can be so many different email service providers and programs
for reading and writing email.

In addition to that, I refuse to support any means of communication that
jeopardizes users' privacy, be it inherently or intentionally. Every
system where one entity can access every user's data is inherently
insecure, because that party can be pressured to reveal the
information.  Intentionally ridding users of their privacy is also
common, even in decentralized systems like email. For example, Google,
Facebook and Microsoft read the email sent to any address they operate
for you, analyze it, sell their findings and snitch on you if it is
beneficial to them.

Even if your service provider does not spy on you, there is still enough
to be concerned of -- NSA (and several other countries' equivalents) are
well known for recording all internet traffic they can for later
analysis. The only way to have true privacy online is to use
cryptography, so even those who have access to your messages cannot
access their contents.

I am willing to use anything that is an open standard, isn't hazardous
to privacy by itself and is forwards-compatible with real,
cryptographic, privacy.
I strongly prefer to have encryption turned on, but I also
accept unencrypted communication over the same channels.


I use email, XMPP, Jingle and IRC every day. All of these are open standards.
My service provider [promises](http://www.autistici.org/en/services.html)
to take my privacy seriously and all evidence is consistent with their
claims.

- Email can be used privately with [OpenPGP](http://andres.tedx.ee/blog/2013-08-10-how-to-use-openpgp-for-email-in-1000-words/)
- XMPP (and other instant messaging protocols) can be used privately with
  [OTR](https://securityinabox.org/en/pidgin_main)
- Jingle, the audio-video extension for XMPP, can be
  [used](http://apapadop.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/a-skype-alternative-worth-its-salt-jitsi/) privately with ZRTP using
  [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/). It can do anything Skype can do, and more.
- I use IRC to participate in open discussions where anybody is
  welcome to listen and join in. I haven't investigated whether it would
  be feasible to use it privately.

I occasionally use *Diaspora* and *pump.io*. They are standardized and
decentralized, but using them privately is inconvenient
(copy-pasting OpenPGP messages would work everywhere, though).

I wouldn't mind using *PSYC*, *RetroShare* or *SecureShare*, but I don't
know anybody else who used them, so I would be talking to myself. The
same goes for many other open communications platforms.

*Facebook* isn't and has never been either private or standardized.

*Skype* used to be private, but Microsoft bought it, and now it is as
bad as any other Microsoft service. It has never been an open standard,
there event aren't any open source client programs.

*MSN* (yes, it still works) isn't either an open standard or private.
There are open source client programs (some of which even support OTR),
so it is better than Skype.
