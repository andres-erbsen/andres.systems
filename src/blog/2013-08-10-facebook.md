Inviting, isn't it? But that's how Facebook started. It's a bit bigger now,
to be honest, but that core idea has not changed.

Links added. For those who are interested of more, there are
[long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook)
[lists](http://stallman.org/facebook) of Facebook's unethical deeds, and even
these are *far* from complete. For one, Facebook is happy to
censor anything you don't like (e.g., anti-budget-cut posters) if you can pay them, and they reveal identities of
authors of controversial posts (for example during the Arab Spring) even to
publicly violent regimes without even considering what might happen to these
people afterward. They even have automated surveillance that tips off the police
if you do something "suspicious". What counts as suspicious is up to them to
determine, of course.

But you're smarter than that, right? You still could use Facebook, just for the
stuff that really cannot do any harm? Or you say you have nothing to hide at
all? Well, sort of.

Limiting the information you give Facebook (and anybody they sell it to) enough
that it really cannot do any harm is not easy.
[Research](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/11/facebook-users-reveal-intimate-secrets?CMP=twt_fd)
 has shown that
information such as diseases, political views, IQ and sexual orientation can
be inferred from seemingly innocent Facebook activity. And even if you really
don't have anything to hide, you'd hope that whatever methods are used to
analyze your data reach the same conclusion. If you still regard privacy as
hiding wrong, please take the time and read
[this excellent piece](https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/)
by Daniel J. Solove.

So yes, you probably can use Facebook without risking being discriminated too
much because of what you reveal. But I have no interest in meeting just the
"Facebook-safe" self-censored part of you. The real world is full of struggles
and controversies, full of life, and that's what makes it interesting. I've
never been good at small talk, so when offered to join a website where I could
do only that I am definitely not interested.

As a final note, please, when you organize something, do not exclude those who
do not use Facebook by only announcing it there.
