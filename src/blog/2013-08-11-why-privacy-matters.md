From <https://www.privacyinternational.org/blog/why-privacy-matters>:

> Privacy International asked lawyers, activists, researchers and hackers at
> Defcon 2012 about some of the debates that thrive at the intersection between
> law, technology and privacy. We also wanted to know why privacy matters to
> them, and what they thought the future of privacy looked like. This video is a
> result of those conversations.

> Featuring Cory Doctorow, Kade Crockford, Jameel Jaffer, Dan Kaminsky, Chris
> Soghoian, Marcia Hoffman, Moxie Marlinspike, Phil Zimmerman, Hanni Fakhoury
> and Eli O. Many thanks to Michelle Leddon for creating this video.

I also find

one-page explaination by Cory Doctorow very interesting.
