I have been thinking of doing this for a long time, but now as appelbaum and
dingledine called for similar stuff at 30C3, I have no excuse not to.

Ask me anything about privacy, computer security, surveillance, freedom of
speech, software and the internet in general. I talk about it a lot anyway, so
it would be a shame if something you'd like to hear about doesn't make it
through. There are no stupid questions, there are only honest ones.
Any time and means of communication you consider reasonable is probably fine by
me. And bring your friends, the more the merrier. If you've got five people I
promise to schedule a dedicated time slot for you, with presentations and demos
if possible about the relevant topic.

If you'd like to read a book instead, I recommend Cory Doctorow's novel
[Little Brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/) and the [CryptoParty
handbook](http://mirror-de.cryptoparty.is/handbook/). The [guide for
journalists](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/encryption-works)
by Freedom of Press Foundation is quite brief and practical.
