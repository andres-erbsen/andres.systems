title: Life choices: past, present, future

Over the last 24 hours I have stumbled across three amazing articles that also
happen to form a reasonable sample of my thoughts about making long-term
decisions. The text under each link represents my reflections on the piece, not
an overview or advertisement.

Those of you who have read *Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss might
especially appreciate this one. The Indian movie Three Idiots also comes to
mind. Just once more reference -- and then to the point --  in somebody else's
words again: "Congratulations on getting into MIT. You have made it in life.
You can stop caring now".

The technical, and more broadly, intellectual, community I have been
interacting with has an interesting mix of goals. On the one end there is what
feels like the "expected path": pursuing the status and power we are uniquely
in a position to achieve, and doing so with all the time and energy we have
got. Even at MIT, where the vast majority of possible outcomes are "definitely
good enough" by any reasonable standards, the opportunities for doing
interesting technical work reached me *after* advertisements for the resume
polishing sessions of the Office of GE-something-something and Career
Development.

Digging deeper, I do hear about people who took of with their life and did
something totally different with their lives. Even then, the most visible
examples are the ones which make those participating in the rat race envious:
top-notch technical projects guided by broader goals and tighter-held views.
[Andrew Huang](http://www.bunniestudios.com/), [Moxie
Marlinspike](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/career-advice/), and [Marcin
Jakubowski](http://www.ted.com/speakers/marcin_jakubowski) are the first that
come to mind. After some thinking, I can recall stories of people who took a gap
year after Bachelor's, and most likely did something really cool with it, but
the question I would expect after telling a story like this would be "how are
they doing now?", meaning "how badly did neglecting the rat-race affect their
life?". And I wish I had the confidence to say that "they are doing just fine".
Furthermore, it is worrying that all the examples that I manage to classify as
"strictly positive" also involve overwhelming intellectual achievement -- what
if you *need* to be above and beyond to whistle at the treadmill? I don't
actually believe that it is necessary, but it would be very, very comforting to
know that for sure, and that confirmation has been hard to find.

This one really makes me proud of my current job. The world tends to believe
the one who acts first, and the [email-address-based
interface](/blog/2015-07-22-another-take-at-public-key-distribution/) I am
building for [good old email
encryption](/blog/2013-08-10-how-to-use-openpgp-for-email-in-1000-words/) might
actually make a difference in reaching critical userbase for private communications.  It is a lot harder
politically to ban an open standard implemented by multiple major email
providers than a command-line program known to a bunch of nerds.  I do hope
that politics works out in the public's favor, but if does end up being
[1996](http://cr.yp.to/export/status.html) all over again, I hear the
[PoC||GTFO](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo08.pdf) has a thing
or two to teach about [grammar (8.12)](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo08.pdf) and
[publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat).
