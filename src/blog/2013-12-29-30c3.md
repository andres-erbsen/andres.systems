There are many great talks, but just first two I watched made my day.

[The Year in Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fty107Us7oc) by [djb](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html), [tanja](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nadiah/) and [nadiah](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nadiah/). Fun and relaxing, but still touches on quite many gritty details of what really goes around in the world of applied cryptography while requiring next to 0 background.

[Glenn Greenwald Keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEJIR0-KJu0) - A serious and relatively complete overview of the status quo and perspectives of privacy and accountability in the world.
