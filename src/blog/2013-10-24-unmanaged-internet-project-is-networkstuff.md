I found it. It does exist. <http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/uia/> is too close to the
network system that I have been trying to implement to ignore it. It has
cryptographic identifiers. It has source routing. It does not have NAT or any
other perimeterization mechanism. It is just, almost, awesome.

It seems that there is still work top be done to maximize the reliability, but
for non-vapourware, the current state is pretty damn good.

No surprise I didn't finish it during my two last years of high school. UIA is
one person's doctoral thesis project, and the two of the six authors that are
familiar to me are so because they are one of the best in this field.
